# Getting Started
  
- ANTLR tour - playground

First of all, before starting to develop a language applications we need to know the grammar of that language, and need to have a language-recognizer tool (e.g ANTLR) which understands that language and generates the parsers using pre-defined language grammars.  Also, to make the language application integrated with IDEs to provide modern coding and debugging experiences, we need to implement a language server and a client  which have to be conformance with LSP   and DAP  specifications.
